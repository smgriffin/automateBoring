1. [] is an empty list value in the same way '' is the empty string value

2.  spam[2] = 'Hello'

spam = ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd']

3. d
int('3' * 2) is '33' then divided by 11 = 3.

4. d

5. a b

bacon = [3.14, 'cat', 11, 'cat', True]

6. 1

7. [3.14, 'cat', 11, 'cat', True, 99]

8. [3.14, 11, 'cat', True]

9. + and *

10. Append adds to the end of the list.  Insert places it in the index you specify.

11. del and remove()

12. Can get len()
	+ to concatenate * replicate
	can be sorted using sort()
	string liek list of single text characters
	slicing
	using them with for loops and len()
	in and not in operators

13. Lists are mutable and tuples are immuatable.  Lists [] and tuples ()

14. tup = (42,) trailing comma

15. you can use the tuple() function for tuple form of list value and list() function for list form of tuple.

16. Variables that contain lists actually contain a reference to the list values.

17. You use copy.deepcopy() if you have lists that contain inner lists.  The deepcopy() function will copy the inner lists as well.

	copy.copy() function will do a shallow copy of a list, while the copy.deepcopy() will do a deep copy of a list.  That is, only copy.deepcopy() will duplicated any lists inside the list.
